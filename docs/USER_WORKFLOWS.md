# User Workflows: Project OVERLORD

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the primary user paths within Project OVERLORD. Our focus is on minimizing cognitive load while maximizing the output of the AI cognitive engine.

## 2. Persona: The "Scale-Up" Creator
- **Goal:** Transform a 60-minute podcast into 10 TikToks, 5 LinkedIn posts, and 1 Newsletter.
- **Pain Point:** Spending 10+ hours editing and formatting manually.

## 3. Workflow A: The "Master Asset" Transformation (Core Loop)
This is the primary journey where value is created.

1.  **Entry:** User lands on Dashboard and clicks "New Project".
2.  **Ingestion:** 
    - User uploads a video file OR pastes a YouTube/Google Drive link.
    - User selects "Processing Depth" (Fast vs. Deep Analysis).
3.  **AI Analysis (Background):**
    - System transcribes, identifies "Viral Moments," and extracts key themes.
4.  **Review & Selection:**
    - User views a list of "AI-Suggested Clips."
    - User previews clips and selects the ones to proceed with.
5.  **Brand Application:**
    - User selects a "Brand Voice" or "Visual Template" (pre-configured).
    - AI applies captions, overlays, and color grading.
6.  **Final Export/Publish:**
    - User reviews the final renders.
    - User clicks "Publish to All" or downloads assets for manual upload.

## 4. Workflow B: Brand Identity Setup (Onboarding)
Ensuring the AI maintains the "Identity" pillar.

1.  **Identity Profile:** User creates a "Brand Kit."
2.  **Visual DNA:** Upload logos, select fonts, and define color palettes.
3.  **Voice DNA:** 
    - User provides 3 examples of previous writing (Captions/Tweets).
    - AI analyzes tone (e.g., "Professional yet Witty").
4.  **Template Creation:** AI generates 3 dynamic video templates based on DNA for user approval.

## 5. Workflow C: The Asset Librarian (Management)
Managing the "Intelligence Asset Management" (IAM) system.

1.  **Library Access:** User enters the "Asset Vault."
2.  **Semantic Search:** User types "Find the part where I talked about Bitcoin" (AI searches transcription, not just filenames).
3.  **Cross-Pollination:** User selects an existing clip and requests a "Format Shift" (e.g., Turn this TikTok video into a Carousel Post).
