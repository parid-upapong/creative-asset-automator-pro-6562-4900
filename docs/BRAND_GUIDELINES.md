# Project Overlord: Brand Identity & Tone

## 1. Personality
- **Authoritative:** We are the "Overlord" that manages the chaos.
- **Sleek:** Minimalist, high-tech, and efficient.
- **Empowering:** We don't replace the creator; we amplify them.

## 2. Visual Identity
- **Primary Color:** Deep Obsidian (#0A0A0A) - Representing the void of the backend.
- **Accent Color:** Electric Violet (#8B5CF6) - Representing the spark of AI intelligence.
- **Typography:** Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for data/technical elements.

## 3. Communication Style
- **Brevity over Fluff:** Direct instructions and clear value statements.
- **Action-Oriented:** Use verbs like "Automate," "Amplify," and "Dominate."
- **Transparent:** Be clear about what the AI is doing and where the human needs to provide the final touch.

## 4. User Experience Goal
The user should feel like they have a "Second Brain" that handles all the boring tasks, leaving them with the "God Mode" ability to focus purely on creativity.
