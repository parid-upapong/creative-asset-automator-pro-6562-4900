# UX Principles for Project OVERLORD

To ensure we meet our strategic objectives, every screen must adhere to these rules:

1.  **The "One-Click" Rule:** For any repetitive task (e.g., adding subtitles), there must be a way to automate it with a single click or a pre-set.
2.  **Contextual Intelligence:** The system should suggest the best platform for a clip. *Example: "This 15-second high-energy clip is perfect for Instagram Reels."*
3.  **Non-Destructive Editing:** The user must always be able to revert to the original "Master Asset" or the "AI-Suggested" version before their edits.
4.  **Transparency:** When AI makes a decision (e.g., cutting a clip), show a brief "Reasoning" tag (e.g., "Reason: High-intensity audio detected").
5.  **Brand Consistency Check:** Before publishing, provide a "Brand Score" to ensure the asset aligns with the user's defined identity.
